## Requirements for attending this workshop 


In order to participate in this hands-on session, you MUST have installed the latest version of Eclipse and the latest version of the ABAP Development Tools (ADT) in Eclipse.
Please check the following two short documents how to do this if you have not already done it:  
- [Install the ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-install-adt.html)  
- [Adapt the Web Browser settings in your ADT installation](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-rap-workshops/blob/main/requirements_rap_workshops.md#4-adapt-the-web-browser-settings-in-your-adt-installation)  
 
You also need a user on an SAP S/4HANA Cloud ABAP Environment system or on a SAP S/4HANA on prem or private cloud system. The on premise system must have a relase equal or higher SAP S/4HANA 2022.

## Overview


**ABAP Cloud**  
… is the ABAP development model to build cloud-ready business apps, services and extensions  
… comes with SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA  
… works with public or private cloud, and even on-premise  

This hands-on workshop will guide you to build developer extensions using *ABAP Cloud* in an SAP S/4HANA system using RAP facades. 

A RAP facade is a *released* business object interface built with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP).

You will create your own transactional Fiori elements app with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) and use released RAP facades to enhance the existing functionality. 

### Business Scenario 

 The scenario we will implement will be an online shop for employees which will allow for the creation of *Purchase Requisitions* by using a released RAP facade from Procurements.   
 
 - An existing customer/partner wants to create a new business application that will allow employees of a company to order certain articles such as laptops for quick delivery using this shopping app. This can be realized with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP). 
 
 - You’ll build the application starting from a database table using an ADT wizard that generates a starter project wich contains all the needed development RAP artefacts that have to be implemented. The generated business service will be transactional, draft-enabled, and enriched with UI semantics for the generation of the Fiori elements app.

<!--
 - Now, the customer/partner wishes to enhance the existing online shop application. After an order is placed, it should be possible to initiate a purchase requisition for this order in the SAP S/4HANA system. Using the developer extensibility custom code can be added to the existing business logic of the online shop BO to fulfill this requirementand by calling the released RAP facade **I_PurchaseRequisitionTP** locally.
 -->

Your application will finally look like this:

### Architecture Overview


The figure below illustrates the high-level architecture components of the cloud extensibility model used in SAP S/4HANA public Cloud, SAP S/4HANA private cloud and SAP S/4HANA on premise systems.
